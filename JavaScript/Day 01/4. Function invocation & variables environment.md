```js

var x = 1;
a():
b():
console.log(x);

function a(){
	var x = 10;
	console.log(x);
}

function b(){
	var x = 100;
	console.log(x);
}
```

Running this code we get the output,
10
100
1

Explanation:

The execution context is created when the code is first run and it goes through the creation phase and allocates memory to x, a(), b() but no values are assigned.


In the execution phase, x = 1 is initialized in the global scope. 

Now the execution context for the function scope of a() is created and a() is executed.
In the scope of the functions execution context, x = 10. Therefore we print, 10.

Now the same process is done for b(). In its scope b = 100, therefore we print 100.

Now the execution moves to, console.log(x), in its scope, which is global, x = 1.
Therefore we print 1.


The call stack would look like this;

global 
global -> a()
global (a is popped)
global -> b()
global (b is popped)
global
destroyed
