In JavaScript, the `this` keyword always refers to an **object**. The thing about it is that the object it refers to will vary depending on how and where `this` is being called.

|   |
|---|
|In an object method, `this` refers to the **object**.|
|Alone, `this` refers to the **global object**.|
|In a function, `this` refers to the **global object**.|
|In a function, in strict mode, `this` is `undefined`.|
|In an event, `this` refers to the **element** that received the event.|
|Methods like `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()` can refer `this` to **any object**.|


### 1. Global
If we call `this` by itself, meaning not within a function, object, or whatever, it will refer to the global window object.

If you print it like `console.log('this alone', this);` you'll get this in your console: `[object Window]`.

### 2. Object

But if we call `this` within an object method, like in the following example:

```javacsript
const person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName : "Doe",
    id       : 5566,
    getThis : function() {
      return this;
    }
};

console.log('this in object method', person.getThis());
```

So, like this we can access properties of an object using, this

```javascript
const person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName : "Doe",
    id       : 5566,
    getFullName : function() {
      return this.name + ' ' + this.lastName;
    }
};

console.log('this in object method', person.getFullName());
```


### 3. Function

If we call `this` within a function like in the following example:

```javascript
function test() {
    console.log('this in a function', this);
}

test()
```

`this` will now refer again to the general window object, and we'll get this in our console: `[object Window]`.


## `this` Methods (call, apply and bind)



### Call Method

With `call` we can invoke a method passing an owner object as an argument. Said in a simpler way, we can call a method indicating to which object the keyword `this` will refer to.

used to call an object method with another object as argument.

Let's see an example:

```javascript
const person1 = {
    name: 'Pedro',
    surname: 'Sanchez',
    sayName: function() {
        return this.name + " " + this.surname;
    }
}

const person2 = {
    name: 'Jimena',
    surname: 'Juarez'
}

console.log(person1.sayName.call(person2));
```


### Bind method

With the `bind()` method, an object can borrow a method from another object.

```js
const person = {  
  firstName:"John",  
  lastName: "Doe",  
  fullName: function () {  
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;  
  }  
}  
  
const member = {  
  firstName:"Hege",  
  lastName: "Nilsen",  
}  
  
let fullName = person.fullName.bind(member);
```


### Apply method

With the `apply()` method, you can write a method that can be used on different objects.
The `apply()` method is similar to the `call()` method

```js
const person = {  
  fullName: function() {  
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;  
  }  
}  
  
const person1 = {  
  firstName: "Mary",  
  lastName: "Doe"  
}  
  
// This will return "Mary Doe":  
person.fullName.apply(person1);
person.fullName.call(person1, "Oslo", "Norway"); //with args
```


## The Difference Between call() and apply()

The difference is:

The `call()` method takes arguments **separately**.

The `apply()` method takes arguments as an **array**.
