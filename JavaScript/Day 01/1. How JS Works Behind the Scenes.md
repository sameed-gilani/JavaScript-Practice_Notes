#### TLDR:

The creation phase includes creating the global and function execution contexts, creating the scope chain, and allocating memories for the variables and functions. During the execution phase, the JavaScript engine executes the code line by line. This includes evaluating and executing statements.
The call stack stores the execution contexts as functions are invoked, maintaining the order of execution of the execution contexts.

----------------------------------

JS has an **Execution Context** that handles the entire transformation and execution of the code.

There are two types of execution contexts: 
	1. Global
		Created when JS first starts to run and is the global scope
	2. Function
		Created whenever a function is called, represents that individual functions scope

The execution context has two phases:
	1. Creation Phase:
		The JS engine creates the environment and sets up the scripts environment.
		Allocates memory for variable and functions
	2. Execution Phase:
		Here the JS engine starts executing the code inside the Execution Context.


The Execution Context has two components:

![[Pasted image 20231009122405.png]]


At the very beginning, the JavaScript engine executes the entire source code, creates a global execution context, and then does the following things:

    Creates a global object that is window in the browser and global in NodeJs.
    Sets up a memory for storing variables and functions.
    Stores the variables with values as undefined and function references.


Considering the following code

```JavaScript
var n = 5;

function square(n) {
  var ans = n * n;
  return ans;
}

var square1 = square(n);
var square2 = square(8);  

console.log(square1)
console.log(square2)

```

Now the execution phase begins,

It starts running the code line by line.
Initially the variable n was created in memory but its value is not assigned until execution. When it gets to n = 5 in the code, n is assigned that value.
It allocates the function Square() in memory (Stores the whole function code)and directly jumps to the function invocation,
var square1 = square(n)

So the Execution Context looks like this,

![[Pasted image 20231009123219.png]]

A function scope execution context is created.
It runs the function and calculates and assigns the values and the Execution Context looks like this.

Once execution is finished, the execution context is destroyed.


### Call Stack:

To keep the track of all the contexts, including global and functional, the JavaScript engine uses a **call stack**.
It maintains the order of execution of all the Execution Contexts.

Initially the a global context is created and pushed on the stack. 
Function execution contexts are pushed onto the stack as they are invoked.
Once execution of a function is complete, its popped (i.e destroyed) from the stack. Eventually at the end the global context is popped when the code is completely executed.

For the following code

```js
function funcA(m,n) {
    return m * n;
}

function funcB(m,n) {
    return funcA(m,n);
}

function getResult(num1, num2) {
    return funcB(num1, num2)
}

var res = getResult(5,6);

console.log(res); // 30
```


The global context is pushed on the stack.
Then getResults() -> funcB() -> funcA()
Like so,

* The call stack has its own fixed size depending on the system or browser. If the number of contexts exceeds the limit, then a stack overflow error will occur.
